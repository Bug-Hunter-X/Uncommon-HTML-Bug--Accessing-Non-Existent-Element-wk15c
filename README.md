This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common error in HTML: attempting to access a DOM element that has not been defined in the HTML structure. The script included attempts to manipulate an element with the ID 'myDiv2' which does not exist. This results in a JavaScript error being thrown silently in many browsers. The solution shows how to correctly check for element existence.
